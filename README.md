Usage:

    Download the Exiled version DLL file.

    Place the DLL in the Roaming\EXILED\Plugins directory.

    After entering the game, a configuration file (in Chinese) will be generated. You can translate it yourself... since the plugin author is Chinese, you can handle this.

Plugin Rules:

    D-Class personnel will display the tag: "Rebellion Value: 0/200". (You can fully customize parameters in the config file).

    Rebellion Value increases per second when a D-Class is near armed Chaos Insurgency (CI) members or other armed D-Class personnel.

    Picking up/holding a weapon directly adds 100 Rebellion Value.

    Harming Foundation personnel adds 999 Rebellion Value.

    Security guards and MTF Nu-7 ("Nine-Tailed Fox") can check a D-Classâ€™s Rebellion Value to decide whether to execute them.

Order. May this plugin bring order to your server.
